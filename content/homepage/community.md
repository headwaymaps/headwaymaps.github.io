This project would be impossible without the tireless work of the OpenStreetMap community. If you've spent time and effort contributing the larger OpenStreetMap ecosystem, thank you. In particular, Headway relies on the following projects in no particular order:

* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about)
* [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler)
* [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/)
* [Pelias](https://www.pelias.io/)
* [OpenTripPlanner](https://www.opentripplanner.org/)
* [Valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla)
* [Who's On First](https://www.whosonfirst.org/)
* [MobilityData database](https://database.mobilitydata.org/)
* And many others

Additionally, Headway is able to automate much of the build process thanks to the [BBBike extract service](https://extract.bbbike.org/).
